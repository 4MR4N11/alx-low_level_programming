# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project is about learning how to use variables, conditionals, loops, and functions in C.

## Files

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c) File that contains a program that will print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

- [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c) File that contains a program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed, and print whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n` is greater than 5, is 0, or is less than 6 and not 0.

- [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c) File that contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c) File that contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

- [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c) File that contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except `q` and `e`.

- [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c) File that contains a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

- [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c) File that contains a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only `putchar` function.

- [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c) File that contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

- [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c) File that contains a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c) File that contains a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

- [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c) File that contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

- [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c) File that contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

- [102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c) File that contains a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
