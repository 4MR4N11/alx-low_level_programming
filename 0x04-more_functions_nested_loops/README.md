# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This Project is about functions and nested loops in C programming language.

## Files

- [main.h](./main.h) Header file containing all function prototypes.

- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) File that contains the `_putchar` function.

- [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c) File that contains a function `_isupper` that checks for uppercase character.

- [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c) File that contains a function `_isdigit` that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c) File that contains a function `mul` that multiplies two integers.

- [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) File that contains a function `print_numbers` that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c) File that contains a function `print_most_numbers` that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9(2 and 4 excluded), followed by a new line.

- [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c) File that contains a function `more_numbers` that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

- [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c) File that contains a function `print_line` that draws a straight line in the terminal.

- [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c) File that contains a function `print_diagonal` that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

- [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c) File that contains a function `print_square` that prints a square, followed by a new line.

- [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c) File that contains a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

- [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c) File that contains a function `print_triangle` that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

- [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c) File that contains a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.
