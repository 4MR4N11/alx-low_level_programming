# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings.

This project is about pointers, arrays and strings in C programming language.

## Files

- [main.h](./main.h) Header file containing all function prototypes.

- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) File that contains the `_putchar` function.

- [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c) File that contains a function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

- [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c) File that contains a function `swap_int` that swaps the values of two integers.

- [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c) File that contains a function `_strlen` that returns the length of a string.

- [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c) File that contains a function `_puts` that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.

- [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c) File that contains a function `print_rev` that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c) File that contains a function `rev_string` that reverses a string.

- [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c) File that contains a function `puts2` that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.

- [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c) File that contains a function `puts_half` that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

- [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c) File that contains a function `print_array` that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c) File that contains a function `_strcpy` that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

- [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c) File that contains a function `_atoi` that converts a string to an integer.

- [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c) File that contains a program that generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).
