This project is about recursion.

## Files

 - [main.h](./main.h) Header file containing all function prototypes.

 - [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) File that contains the `_putchar` function.

 - [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c) File that contains a function `puts_recursion` that prints a string, followed by a new line.

 - [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) File that contains a function `print_rev_recursion` that prints a string in reverse.

 - [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c) File that contains a function `strlen_recursion` that returns the length of a string.

 - [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c) File that contains a function `factorial` that returns the factorial of a given number.

 - [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c) File that contains a function `pow_recursion` that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

 - [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c) File that contains a function `sqrt_recursion` that returns the natural square root of a number.

 - [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c) File that contains a function `is_prime_number` that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`.
 
 - [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c) File that contains a function `is_palindrome` that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not.
