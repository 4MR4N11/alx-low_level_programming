# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

This Project is about function pointers in C programming language.

## Files

- [function_pointers.h](./function_pointers.h) Header file containing all function prototypes except task 3.

- [0-print_name.c](./0-print_name.c) File that contains a function `print_name` that prints a name.

- [1-array_iterator.c](./1-array_iterator.c) File that contains a function `array_iterator` that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

- [2-int_index.c](./2-int_index.c) File that contains a function `int_index` that searches for an integer.

- [3-calc.h](./3-calc.h) Header file containing all function prototypes and the definition of the structure `op_t`.

- [3-op_functions.c](./3-op_functions.c) File that contains the following functions:
  - `op_add` that returns the sum of a and b.
  - `op_sub` that returns the difference of a and b.
  - `op_mul` that returns the product of a and b.
  - `op_div` that returns the result of the division of a by b.
  - `op_mod` that returns the remainder of the division of a by b.

- [3-get_op_func.c](./3-get_op_func.c) File that contains a function `get_op_func` that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.

- [3-main.c](./3-main.c) File that contains a program that performs simple operations.
