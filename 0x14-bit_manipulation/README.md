# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

This Project is about Bit manipulation in C programming language.

## Files

- [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing all function prototypes.

- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): File containing the `_putchar` function.

- [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): File that contains a function `binary_to_uint` that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.

- [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): File that contains a function `print_binary` that prints the binary representation of a number.

- [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): File that contains a function `get_bit` that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

- [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c): File that contains a function `set_bit` that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.

- [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): File that contains a function `clear_bit` that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.

- [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): File that contains a function `flip_bits` that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
